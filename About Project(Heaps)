This project will help you with th practical implementation of the Heap Data Structure;

Heaps are Hirarichal Data Structures that are balanced and at most contains two childern per node.

int the given source code you will be able to accomplish Heap operations using ARRAY Representation.

Following Operation Can be performed :
1) Building Trees
2) insertion
3) Deletion
4) Sort (Ascending)
5) Sort (Descending)
6) Minheapification
7) Maxheapification
